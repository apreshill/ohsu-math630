# Invariance properties

The question of what does not change during statistical operations refers to invariance properties

--

What stays constant under certain transformations is a key concept is modern statistics, as well as other branches of science

--

Einstein actually wanted to call his theory of relativity the “theory of invariants”- what remains invariant in the space-time continuum (http://www.economist.com/node/3518580)

---

# What did we just show?

List-wise addition or subtraction 
- Moves the numbers as a group, as though they were mounted on a rigid stick, and slid to the left or right.
- Does not change any of the distances between numbers.

--

List-wise multiplication or division
- Can move the numbers as a group
- But also causes them to "fan in" or "fan out."


---

# Limitations of lists

--

Number of rows/columns

--

We started by showing how all the information in a list of $n$ numbers can be re-expressed in terms of $n$ new numbers

$$ list_x \longrightarrow list_y$$
--

These new numbers contain all the information in the original list, and the original list can be perfectly reconstructed from the new list

---

# Descriptive statistics

Measures of location or central tendency
- In general, in what region is the list located on the number line?
- What number is typical of the entire list?
- What number is in the center of the list?

--

Measures of spread or variability
- How far is the list spread out over the number line?

--

Measures of shape
- Pattern of relative interval sizes, moving from left to right

# The sample mode

The most frequently occurring value in a list

```{r}
# compute the statistical mode of a vector of numbers
stat.mode <- function(x) {
    freqs <- tapply(x, x, length)
    as.numeric(names(freqs)[which.max(freqs)][1])

stat.mode(x)
```

You don't need to understand the above R function

---

# The sample mean

The arithmetic mean of the data

$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$$

where $x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n$ represent the $n$ observed values.

--

Number with the smallest sum of *squared* distances to the list of numbers

--

Hence, the mean is a *least squares estimator*

--

Unless ALL scores are identical, most if not all, scores will be different from the mean.

#  start here

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100,50,12) #draws 100 samples from normal dist., M=50, SD=12
y <- 2*x + 5 #y is a linear transformation of x
z.x <- (x - mean(x))/sd(x) #makes z-scores using x
z.y <- (y - mean(y))/sd(y) #makes z-scores using y

```

What does the above show?
What will be the location, spread, and shape of the new numbers in z.x? In z.y?

---

# Skewness

Skewness statistics provide information about departures from symmetry

--

Draws on all 3 measures of location

--

The standard definition of skewness in a population is the average cubed z-score

--

![](01-images/skew.png)

---


# Calculating skewness

Here is one way to calculate skewness, using the formula for the adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient, $G_1$:

$$G_1 = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{x}}^3$$


```{r}
g1_calculate <- function(x = data){
  s3.x <- sum((x-mean(x))^3/sd(x)^3) # right side of eq
  n <- length(x)
  g1 <- (n/((n-1)*(n-2)))*s3.x
  return(g1)
}
```


---


# Calculating skewness
```{r}
# install.packages("moments")
library(moments)
skewness(x)
```


---

# Kurtosis

The basic idea of kurtosis is that it is the average 4th power of the z-scores
Kurtosis of a distribution is typically expressed relative to that of a normal distribution.

--

The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. So, the most common measure of kurtosis is the average 4th power of the z-scores minus 3.

--

This can be computed in a number of ways. The simplest version is biased for a normal distribution, but is reported by some programs.

--

If the data have high kurtosis due to long tails, then the sample mean may be an unreliable estimator of the population mean.

--

Standard formulas for the variance of the sample correlation and sample variance can be seriously in error if the data come from a population with high kurtosis.

---

# Calculating kurtosis

```{r}
s4.x <- sum((x-mean(x))^4) #using raw
s2.x <- sum((x-mean(x))^2) #using raw
n <- length(x)
n*s4.x/s2.x^2
# [1] 2.438948
s4.z <- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^4) #using z
s2.z <- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^2) #using z
n*s4.z/s2.z^2
# [1] 2.438948

---

- We explored quantitative data using different types of graphic plots

--

- We developed some intuition about properties of our data that are meaningful, vulnerable, and robust (i.e., invariant) under specific conditions

--

- We discussed and calculated meaningful descriptive statistics to measure location, spread, and shape

--

- We demonstrated how list-wise operations can impact measures of location, spread, and shape

--

- We have proven that for any list of numbers with non-zero spread, the z-score transformation produces numbers with the same shape (same skewness, same kurtosis) as the original numbers but with location of 0 and spread of 1.
