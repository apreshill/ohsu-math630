## At some point in the research process, "data" becomes a list of numbers

--

## This list is often very long!

--

## So how do you talk about your data with others?

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Two ways to talk to others about your data

--

## Words

--

## Plots


---

# Talking about data

Categorical vs quantitative

--

We need a common language

--

For quantitative data:

1. Central tendency
2. Spread
3. Shape

# A simple sample

# List-wise operations

--

What happens to a list of numbers when we apply the same transformation to every number in the list?

--

List-wise operations can be summarized in a simple equation

--

`$$y = x + 2$$`


*&lt;center&gt;“add 2 to every number in list `\(x\)` and put this in a new list called `\(y\)`”&lt;/center&gt;*

# Invariance properties

The question of what does not change during statistical operations refers to invariance properties

--

What stays constant under certain transformations is a key concept is modern statistics, as well as other branches of science

--

Einstein actually wanted to call his theory of relativity the “theory of invariants”- what remains invariant in the space-time continuum (http://www.economist.com/node/3518580)

---

# What did we just show?

List-wise addition or subtraction 
- Moves the numbers as a group, as though they were mounted on a rigid stick, and slid to the left or right.
- Does not change any of the distances between numbers.

--

List-wise multiplication or division
- Can move the numbers as a group
- But also causes them to "fan in" or "fan out."


---

# Limitations of lists

--

Number of rows/columns

--

We started by showing how all the information in a list of `\(n\)` numbers can be re-expressed in terms of `\(n\)` new numbers

$$ list_x \longrightarrow list_y$$
--

These new numbers contain all the information in the original list, and the original list can be perfectly reconstructed from the new list

---

# Descriptive statistics

Measures of location or central tendency
- In general, in what region is the list located on the number line?
- What number is typical of the entire list?
- What number is in the center of the list?

--

Measures of spread or variability
- How far is the list spread out over the number line?

--

Measures of shape
- Pattern of relative interval sizes, moving from left to right

Mean

# The sample mode

The most frequently occurring value in a list


```r
# compute the statistical mode of a vector of numbers
stat.mode &lt;- function(x) {
    freqs &lt;- tapply(x, x, length)
    as.numeric(names(freqs)[which.max(freqs)][1])
}
stat.mode(x)
```

```
## [1] 1
```

You don't need to understand the above R function

---

# The sample mean

The arithmetic mean of the data

`$$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$$`

where `\(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n\)` represent the `\(n\)` observed values.

--

Number with the smallest sum of *squared* distances to the list of numbers

--

Hence, the mean is a *least squares estimator*

--

Unless ALL scores are identical, most if not all, scores will be different from the mean.

## List-wise addition/subtraction have no effect on **spread**...

## But, list-wise multiplication/division come straight through to the **spread**.

$$s_y = a \times s_x $$

# Linear transformation theory

| Operation  | Center  | Spread           | Shape|
|:----------:|:-------:|:----------------:|:----:|
| `\(+\)`        | `\(+\)`     | nothing changes  | ?  |
| `\(-\)`        | `\(-\)`     | nothing changes  | ?  |
| `\(\times\)`   | `\(\times\)`| `\(\times\)`         | ?  |
| `\(\div\)`     | `\(\div\)`  | `\(\div\)`           | ?  |

--

So you can only affect the spread of a list of numbers by using multiplication/division.

```

What does the above show?
What will be the location, spread, and shape of the new numbers in z.x? In z.y?

# Skewness

Skewness statistics provide information about departures from symmetry

--

Draws on all 3 measures of location

--

The standard definition of skewness in a population is the average cubed z-score

--

![](01-images/skew.png)

---


# Calculating skewness

Here is one way to calculate skewness, using the formula for the adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficient, `\(G_1\)`:

`$$G_1 = \frac{n}{(n-1)(n-2)}\sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{x}}^3$$`



```r
g1_calculate &lt;- function(x = data){
  s3.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^3/sd(x)^3) # right side of eq
  n &lt;- length(x)
  g1 &lt;- (n/((n-1)*(n-2)))*s3.x
  return(g1)
}
```

# Calculating skewness

# install.packages("moments")

skewness(x)

# Kurtosis

The basic idea of kurtosis is that it is the average 4th power of the z-scores
Kurtosis of a distribution is typically expressed relative to that of a normal distribution.

--

The normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3. So, the most common measure of kurtosis is the average 4th power of the z-scores minus 3.

--

This can be computed in a number of ways. The simplest version is biased for a normal distribution, but is reported by some programs.

--

If the data have high kurtosis due to long tails, then the sample mean may be an unreliable estimator of the population mean.

--

Standard formulas for the variance of the sample correlation and sample variance can be seriously in error if the data come from a population with high kurtosis.

---

# Calculating kurtosis


```r
s4.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^4) #using raw
s2.x &lt;- sum((x-mean(x))^2) #using raw
n &lt;- length(x)
n*s4.x/s2.x^2
```

```

# [1] 2.438948
s4.z &lt;- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^4) #using z
s2.z &lt;- sum((z.x-mean(z.x))^2) #using z

Take 2 minutes to solve for `\(a\)` and `\(b\)`

Try solving for `\(a\)` in the second equation first.

# Linear Transformations

Change shape?



---

- We explored quantitative data using different types of graphic plots

--

- We developed some intuition about properties of our data that are meaningful, vulnerable, and robust (i.e., invariant) under specific conditions

--

- We discussed and calculated meaningful descriptive statistics to measure location, spread, and shape

--

- We demonstrated how list-wise operations can impact measures of location, spread, and shape

--

- We have proven that for any list of numbers with non-zero spread, the z-score transformation produces numbers with the same shape (same skewness, same kurtosis) as the original numbers but with location of 0 and spread of 1.
